# Assembly Code README

This README provides an overview of the assembly code provided in the file. The code is written in x86 assembly language and aims to print a pattern of asterisks (*) followed by a newline character.

## Code Description

The code consists of two sections: `.data` and `.text`. Here's a brief description of each section:

### .data Section

The `.data` section defines two variables:
- `stars`: This variable is a string containing a single asterisk (*) followed by a newline character.
- `new_line`: This variable represents a single newline character.

### .text Section

The `.text` section contains the executable code. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `_start` Label: This is the entry point of the program.

2. Printing Stars:
   - The code uses a system call to print the `stars` variable, which is a string of asterisks.
   - The value `1` is moved to the `rax` register to indicate the system call number for `write`.
   - The value `1` is moved to the `rdi` register to specify the file descriptor for `stdout`.
   - The memory address of the `stars` variable is moved to the `rsi` register as the buffer to be printed.
   - The value `9` is moved to the `rdx` register to indicate the number of bytes to be printed.

3. Printing Individual Asterisks:
   - The code uses a loop to print individual asterisks.
   - The value `1` is moved to the `rax` register to indicate the system call number for `write`.
   - The loop repeatedly invokes the system call to print a single asterisk until the value in the `rdx` register becomes zero.

4. Printing a Newline:
   - After printing the asterisks, the code moves the `new_line` variable to the `rsi` register as the buffer to be printed.
   - The value `1` is moved to the `rdx` register to indicate the number of bytes to be printed.
   - The code then invokes the system call to print a newline character.

5. Program Exit:
   - Finally, the code moves `60` to the `rax` register to indicate the system call number for `exit`.
   - The value `0` is moved to the `rdi` register to represent the exit status.
   - The code invokes the system call to exit the program.

## Usage

To run the code, you'll need an x86 assembler and linker. Here's an example using NASM and GCC:

1. Save the code in a file, for example, `stars.asm`.

2. Assemble the code using NASM:

3. Link the object file using GCC:

4. Run the executable:

Upon running the program, you should see a pattern of asterisks (*) followed by a newline printed to the console.

Feel free to modify the code or explore different variations to enhance your understanding of x86 assembly programming.

Happy coding!
